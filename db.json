    "description":"Alessandra Rich has been championing big collars since the very beginning, making her dresses even more covetable now than ever before. Part of the Spring '21 'Euphoria' collection, this midi style has been been made in Italy from polka-dot silk crepe de chine and is trimmed with pretty macramé. Echo the brand's vintage-inspired styling by belting it at the waist and accessorizing with a crystal brooch.",
