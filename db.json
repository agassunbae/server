    "description":"Alessandra Rich has been championing big collars since the very beginning, making her dresses even more covetable now than ever before. Part of the Spring '21 'Euphoria' collection, this midi style has been been made in Italy from polka-dot silk crepe de chine and is trimmed with pretty macram√©. Echo the brand's vintage-inspired styling by belting it at the waist and accessorizing with a crystal brooch.",

    "description":"'The color palette remains soft and earthy,' says Simon Porte Jacquemus of the Spring '21 collection, L' Amour - it's influenced by the pottery, ceramics or tiles that can be found around his house. Cut for a close fit, this sage-green mini dress is woven with breathable linen that's been chosen for its natural fibers and slightly lower environmental impact. It's draped and gathered in a way that mimics the art of undressing.",
